These programs are to be used on the UNT cse machines to run properly.
pserver.c must be ran on the cse01 server, while client.c must be ran on the cse02 server


To use the proxy server, follow these steps for compiling and running pserver.c

compile using... gcc -o pserver pserver.c

run the program with... ./pserver <port_number>
	you may use a port nubmer of your choosing.
	The program will not execute without being precisely in this format

The proxy will be in an infinite loop while waiting for client requests, unless there is an error within the http request


To send HTTP requests to the porxy, follow these steps for compiling and running client.c
client.c must be ran while the pserver.c code is already running

compile using... gcc -o client client.c

run the program with... ./client <port_number>
	you may use a port number of your choosing.
	This program will not execute without being precisely in this format

The client will prompt for a url to be entered with a "URL:" statement

Enter the desired url and press enter

The http request will be sent to the proxy and forwarded to the web server

The proxy will then forward the web server response, and the client will print out the response

To run another HTTP request, the client must be ran again with the same port number
